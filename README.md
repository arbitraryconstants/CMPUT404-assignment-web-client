Note regarding recvall function
===============================

This function hangs if using HTTP/1.1 for certain requests. For example:

python2 httpclient.py GET "www.adasteam.ca/" hangs for HTTP/1.1 request likey because
the "Connection: close" header is not included in the response from www.adasteam.ca

python2 httpclient.py GET "www.adasteam.ca/" works as expected for HTTP/1.0 request
as the "Connection: close" header is include in the response from www.adasteam.ca

This was discovered after reading the 404 eclass post "Assignment 2 Redirects"

To avoid this issue, the status line of requests is now set to HTTP/1.0 rather than HTTP/1.1
